# Bootstrap project

This a project I've worked on during my 1st year at Sup Galil√©e engineering school. It took me only one night (approximatively 12 hours) to master all the tools I've used. I can say that it was fun how I challenged myself with learning something new during one night and try to make a use out of it ^^.
